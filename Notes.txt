Request → [Logger] → [Zod Validation] → Controller → Service → Database (If anything fails) ↘ [Global Error Handler] → Response

Tools for Measurement
• Profiling: Measures where an application spends its time during execution (e.g., CPU-bound tasks)
• Flame Graphs: A visualization tool for profiling data, showing the call stack and time spent in functions
• Profilers are excellent for CPU-bound tasks but struggle with IO-bound tasks (database queries, external API calls)
• Distributed Tracing: Tracks a request as it flows through the entire system, recording time spent at every step (DB, service layer, external calls)

5 layers: The Big Picture

TypeScript code
   ↓
Prisma Client (generated code)
   ↓
Prisma Adapter (pg / Supabase pooler)
   ↓
Postgres (Supabase)
   ↓
Docker (packaging + runtime)


Prisma lifecycle

schema.prisma
    ↓
prisma generate   ← build time
    ↓
TypeScript compile
    ↓
Runtime Prisma Client

Prisma generates a typed client from the schema.
That client must exist before TypeScript compiles.
Docker builds the app without envs, so Prisma needs a dummy DB URL at build time.
Real credentials are injected only when the container runs.
